<h1 align="center">DO NOT MERGE â€“ as an action.</h1>

This GitHub Action sets a pull request status to pending if the title includes "WIP".

An example workflow looks like this (switch to the <kbd>`<> Edit new file`</kbd> tab when creating a new action and paste the code below):

```workflow
workflow "Set status on pull_request" {
  on = "pull_request"
  resolves = ["Set status"]
}

action "Set status" {
  uses = "wip/action@master"
  secrets = ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
}
```
